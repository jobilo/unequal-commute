Our data was originally published by the Urban Institute, and can be found [here](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/unequal-commute-data),
The Urban Institute published a [study](https://www.urban.org/features/unequal-commute) which is a source of inspiration for our project.

In this repository, the data can be found in the `/data` directory.
It focuses on job availability and accessibility in Seattle, Nashville, Baltimore, and Lansing. The unit of measurement
is a [block group](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_4). The statistics
we are working with measure things like the ratio of available jobs to available workers; the number of low-wage workers;
and how many jobs are accessible by public transportation, as well as racial and ethnic data.
The data was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
